## 💻 Usage Examples
Here are some examples of how you can use the resources in this guide:

### Example 1: Training a Machine Learning Model
This example demonstrates a basic workflow for loading a dataset, training a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance.
1. **Load Dataset**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('your-dataset.csv')
   ```
2. **Train a Linear Regression Model**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```
3. **Evaluate Model**:
   ```python
   model.score(X_test, y_test)
   ```

### Example 2: Build a Simple Neural Network (Using Keras)
This example illustrates how to define and train a simple neural network using Keras for a basic prediction task.
1. **Define the Model**:
   ```python
   from keras.models import Sequential
   from keras.layers import Dense

   model = Sequential([
       Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
       Dense(1)
   ])
   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
   ```
2. **Train the Model**:
   ```python
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
   ```
