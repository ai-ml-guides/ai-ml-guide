# What is AI & ML? - Fundamentals

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

### Key Characteristics of AI:
- **Learning**: Ability to acquire information and rules for using it
- **Reasoning**: Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions
- **Problem-solving**: Tackling various types of challenges
- **Perception**: Scanning surroundings via sensors and making sense of them
- **Language understanding**: Processing human languages into meaningful representations

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

### Types of Machine Learning:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled training data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with an environment

## Deep Learning (DL)

Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). It mimics the workings of the human brain to process data and create patterns for decision-making.

### Key Differences:
- **AI**: Broad concept of machines being able to carry out intelligent tasks
- **ML**: Specific approach within AI that involves learning from data
- **DL**: Advanced technique within ML using multi-layered neural networks

## Historical Context

- **1950s**: Alan Turing proposes the "Turing Test"
- **1956**: Term "Artificial Intelligence" coined at Dartmouth Conference
- **1980s**: Rise of expert systems
- **1990s-2000s**: Machine learning gains prominence
- **2010s-Present**: Deep learning revolution with breakthroughs in image/speech recognition

## Common Applications

### AI Applications:
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Game playing (AlphaGo, chess engines)
- Fraud detection

### ML Applications:
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
- Email spam detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial forecasting
